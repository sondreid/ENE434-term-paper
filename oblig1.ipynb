    "# INF100 Obligatory Assignment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first obligatory assignment! These assignments influence your final grade in the course. See the [course webpage at mitt.uib.no](https://mitt.uib.no/courses/12779) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "By popular demand we're back to the [Zelda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda) theme. More specifically, you'll implement a simple [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_video_games) that plays a not-yet-released Zelda game that we've developed. We expect the game to be a huge success once it hits the market. I think you'll be impressed by the graphics in particular. We haven't yet worked out the licensing deal with Nintendo. Please let us know if you know anyone there.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the previous assignment you're going to work on the same code throughout the assignment. Initially the code will be short. However, as you progress you'll need to add more things. You'll need to both update functions and write new ones. Furthermore, you'll need to take some care to figure out what's wrong when the tests don't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Guidelines\n",
    "These are general guidelines that will (hopefully) help you preserve your sanity through your programming endeavours.\n",
    "* Set aside time to clean up your code. The number that gets bandied around on the internet is that the best programmers spend roughly half their time cleaning up and rewriting their code, i.e., you are halfway done when you get it working.\n",
    "* The sooner you start programming the longer it takes, i.e., make sure you understand the problem and have an idea for how to solve it before you get started. Writing comments first and the code second is often good practice.\n",
    "* Make sure you understand the current assignment before moving on. Building on bedrock is better than building on sand.\n",
    "* You should be spending a significant amount of time on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [Google](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=how+to+python). Even experienced programmers do this.\n",
    "* [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is the official Python style guilde. Following these guidelines makes sure your code is neat and easy to read by you and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deadline\n",
    "* You should submit preliminary version before [**Friday, 2018-09-28 at 23:59:59 (CEST)**](https://www.timeanddate.no/nedtelling/standard?iso=20180928T235959&p0=287&msg=Oblig1+Delinnlevering&font=cursive), and we expect you to be more or less done with Problem 2 by then (if not, you should ask for help!).\n",
    "* Your final version should be done by [**Friday, 2018-10-05 at 23:59:59 (CEST)**](https://www.timeanddate.no/nedtelling/standard?iso=20181005T235959&p0=287&msg=Oblig+1+Innlevering&font=cursive).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can submit and resubmit at any time and as many times as you like; we won't start grading until the final deadline has passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Deadline extensions:* if you need a little bit more time, talk to your teaching assistant and make a schedule for completing the assignment. You don't have to tell us why if it's just a short delay. If there are special circumstances you think we should be aware of, you can contact Anya, May-Lill, Albin or Martha, or studieveileder@ii.uib.no.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll grade your assignment based on two criteria:\n",
    "* For each problem we assign a score that is based on the number of tests your code passes. On top of this we'll award additional points for well-written and commented code. Code conforming to [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) will receive the higest score.\n",
    "* We'll run your code for a set of standardized dungeons and count the number of steps Link needs to complete the dungeon. If you implement `query_decision()` carefully you can minimize the number of steps needed. A low number of average steps will award addiitonal points. With your permission we'd also like to demo especially cool implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically,\n",
    "* 60% of the score is divided evenly over all the test cases. Each additional test case you pass will award an equal number of additional points.\n",
    "* 40% of the score is based on code quality and comments. You'll receive full score if you follow the PEP8 guidelines and if your code is neat and tidy.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of this we'll award up to an additional 10% (beyond the 100% from solving the problems in the assignment) based on how efficiently [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_(The_Legend_of_Zelda)) completes the dungeon as measured by the number of actions. We'll test this on a secret set of dungeons. This requires that you work on your own outside of the problems given in this assignment. You can spend a lot of time on this one if you want to make something really optimized :)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Legend of Zelda: The Lost Puffling\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the game we've developed. The code two cells down from here is the implementation of the actual game. It uses several concepts that have not been covered in the course yet. However, it's sufficient to know that the game calls the `query_decision()` function whenever the player has the opportunity to do something. The game expects this function to return a string representing the action the player wants to carry out. \n",
    "\n",
    "You're going to write `query_decision()` function such that it automatically makes a decision every time it's called. The decision should be based on the information given via the function arguments. By writing this function you're effectively implementing an AI that plays the game on its own. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the game graphical user interface:\n",
    "* The room [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_(The_Legend_of_Zelda)) is in currently is colored red.\n",
    "* Previously visited rooms are colored black.\n",
    "* Rooms adjoining those you've previously visited are colored gray. Because rooms may be placed on top of each other the game may draw a gray square over one that was previously black.\n",
    "* Link's starting point is marked with a green circle. His path through the dungeon is marked with a green line.\n",
    "* The Big Door is marked with a blue square (once discovered).\n",
    "* The Small Chest is marked with a red triangle (once discovered).\n",
    "* The dungeon is procedurally generated, i.e., you get a new dungeon every time you run the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game works like this:\n",
    "* Explore the dungeon by moving around.\n",
    "* Find the small key.\n",
    "* The small key opens the small chest, which is somewhere in the dungeon.\n",
    "* In the small chest you find the boomerang.\n",
    "* You can use the boomerang to get the Big Key, which is somewhere in the dungeon.\n",
    "* The Big Key opens the final room, where the Lost Puffling is trapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be working in the code cell below throughout the whole assignment. For every problem you go back to this cell to make the modifications needed. You'll need to write multiple functions into this cell throughout the assignment. **Make sure to clean up your code between each problem. Otherwise this assignment will become very difficult**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_signature) of the main functions you'll be working on is `query_decision(inventory, room_info, west, north, east, south)`. Its arguments are:\n",
    "* inventory: comma-separated string with items in inventory, e.g., `'boomerang,small key'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* room_info: a string with information about the room, e.g., `'there is a small chest in the room'` or `'you can use the boomerang to open up a new path'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "* west, north, east, south: corresponds to the rooms in the respective direction. A value of `None` means there's no path in that direction. A non-negative integer (e.g., `west >= 0`) means it's possible for the player to move in this direction. The value is the number of times the player has visited that room, e.g., if `west` is `0`, that means it's possible to move to the west and that the player hasn't visited that room before, and a value of 3 means that the player has visited that room 3 times already.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function should always return a string representing the player's choice. The valid string you may return will be given throughout the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "For example, in this case, we have an empty inventory, there are no special features in the room, and we can only go west (and we haven't gone there before), so we'd expect the decision to be `'west'`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d = query_decision('', '', 0, None, None, None)\n",
    "assert d == 'west', \"We need to go west\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "and in this case, we're carrying a small key, there's a small chest in the room (which can presumably be opened by the key), and we can go north or go back east:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d = query_decision('small key', 'There is a small chest in the room.', None, 0, 1, None)\n",
    "assert d == 'open' or d == 'north' or d == 'east', \"Can't do \" + d\n",

    "    <h3 class=\"tip-header\">Tip: print / assert</h3>\n",
    "    <div class=\"tip-body\">\n",
    "        \n",
    "You might want to add a few `print` or `assert` statements to your `query_decision` function, so you can track the decision-making. For example, you might want to print out the arguments:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # We're using string formatting, indicated by the f before the quotes, so\n",
    "    # {inventory} is replaced by the value of the variable inventory\n",

    "    print(f\"Directions: west={west}, north={north}, east={east}, south={south}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "or double-check that our decisions make sense using assert:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    if wanna_go_east:\n",
    "        print(\"Decision: going east\")\n",
    "        assert east != None, \"Can't go east if east is None\"\n",

    "* Out of the directions you can move, return the direction towards a room you've visited the smallest number of times. For example, if the arguments are `greedy_direction(None, 1, 3, 2)`, `\"north\"` is the correct choice. For `greedy_direction(4, None, 2, 2)`, either `\"east\"` or `\"south\"` are correct choices.\n",

For example, you could store a list in a global variable where you store the steps you need to get back to the chest. You could use the same strategy to remember the location of the Big Door.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possible optimization is to never walk back to the room you came from when you exit a room unless there are no other options.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part is meant as preparation for the coming course material and includes materiel not yet covered in the course. Then again, you never have to catch up if you're always getting ahead. This part requires doing more learning on your own. You're in very good shape if you can complete it :)"
